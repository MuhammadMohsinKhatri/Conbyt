✅ Conbyt SEO & Visibility To-Do List
1. Technical Setup (Foundation)

 Verify domain in Google Search Console (✅ already done).

 Submit sitemap.xml (✅ already done).

 Create & fix robots.txt → placed in /public/ folder:

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://conbyt.com/sitemap.xml


 Ensure HTTPS is enforced → redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

 Check indexing in GSC → regularly inspect key URLs.

2. On-Page SEO

 Add meta title + meta description for each important page (use react-helmet or react-helmet-async).

Example for homepage:

<title>Conbyt | Digital Solutions for [Audience]</title>
<meta name="description" content="Conbyt helps [target audience] with [services]. Explore our case studies and solutions." />


 Add H1, H2, H3 headings with keywords (instead of only styled <div>s).

 Add alt text to all images.

 Ensure internal links exist (from homepage → case studies → blog posts).

 Add Open Graph / Twitter meta tags for social sharing.

3. Performance Improvements (Core Web Vitals)

 Optimize images → convert to WebP/AVIF, preload hero image.

 Lazy load below-the-fold images.

 Reduce JS bundle size → use code splitting (React.lazy), remove unused packages.

 Enable caching & compression (Hostinger + Cloudflare).

 Minimize main-thread blocking → avoid long JS tasks.

 Inline critical CSS & preload fonts (font-display: swap).

4. Content Strategy

 Write an About Us section (on LinkedIn + website).

 Create Case Studies as separate URLs (not just sections on the one-pager).

 Start a Blog with:

“Best tools for…” style posts.

Industry insights.

AI-related guides.

 Aim for at least 2 posts/month with keywords in titles.

5. Structured Data (Schema)

 Add Organization schema with name, website, LinkedIn, logo.

 Add WebSite schema with a potentialAction (SearchAction).

 Add Breadcrumb schema if you expand to blogs/case studies.

Example (JSON-LD for homepage):

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Conbyt",
  "url": "https://conbyt.com",

 Crunchbase listing → Add company profile.

 Clutch / GoodFirms / G2 / Capterra → List your business.

 Share blogs & case studies on:

LinkedIn (company + personal profiles).

Twitter/X.

Reddit (relevant subreddits).

Week 3–4 → Publish 1 blog + 1 case study as separate pages. Add schema.

Month 2 → List Conbyt on LinkedIn (optimize), Crunchbase, Clutch, etc.

Great question 🙌 — now you’re thinking like a scalable SEO-first product builder. A one-page React app is sleek for design, but it hurts SEO discoverability because crawlers + AI assistants thrive on structured, multi-page content. Let’s go deeper:

🔹 Advanced SEO & Architecture Strategies for Conbyt (React Website)
1. Architecture Decision: React SPA vs Next.js

Your current site is a React SPA (Single Page Application). By default:

✅ Fast dev

✅ Smooth transitions

❌ Weak SEO (content loaded by JS, crawlers may miss stuff)

Options:

Stick to React SPA → but add:

Pre-rendering (react-snap or prerender.io)

Sitemap for dynamic routes

SSR fallback with Node/Express if needed

Migrate to Next.js (Best Long-Term) →

✅ Built-in Server-Side Rendering (SSR) = SEO-friendly

✅ Static Site Generation (SSG) for blogs/case studies

✅ API routes (no need for backend just to serve blogs)

✅ Image optimization & routing out-of-the-box

👉 If you’re serious about SEO + content → Next.js is the way.

2. Multi-Page vs One-Page

Why not one-page anymore?

One page = only 1 chance to rank.

Multi-page = multiple keywords → multiple ranking opportunities.

What to do:

Keep homepage = overview + call-to-actions.

Add dedicated pages:

/about

/services (if relevant)

/case-studies/[slug]

/blog/[slug]

/contact

This structure allows:

Each page to rank for unique search intent.

Easier internal linking.

Better AI tool indexing (they parse structured pages).

3. Blog & CMS (Content Management)

Right now, publishing blogs manually in React = painful.

Options:

Headless CMS (recommended):

Strapi, Sanity, Contentful, Ghost, WordPress (as headless).

You create blog posts via admin dashboard → published instantly → React/Next.js site fetches content.

Custom Admin Dashboard:

Possible (React + Firebase/Mongo + custom editor).

But reinventing the wheel unless you want full control.

👉 Best pick: Use a Headless CMS for easy publishing, SEO-friendly URLs, and admin comfort.

4. Technical SEO (React/Next.js Focused)

 Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) → crucial for Googlebot.

 Dynamic Sitemap Generator → automatically updates when new blogs/case studies are added.

 robots.txt → already set.

 Canonical tags → avoid duplicate content (Next.js handles well).

 Lazy loading with care → don’t lazy-load critical text (bad for SEO).

 Schema markup for each blog (Article schema).

 Optimize routing → /case-studies/project-name instead of /#section.

5. Performance Tuning (React/Next.js)

Code splitting → load only what’s needed per page.

Image optimization → Next.js <Image> or React + Cloudinary/Imgix.

Critical CSS extraction → via styled-components or Tailwind JIT.

CDN delivery → Cloudflare or Vercel.

Reduce render-blocking JS (Core Web Vitals).

6. Content Strategy Expansion

Build topic clusters:

Blog posts targeting “AI tools for [industry]”

Case studies targeting “How Conbyt helped [X business] with [Y solution]”

Each case study/blog = an internal link hub.

Add FAQ pages (great for Featured Snippets + AI answers).

7. AI Tool Discoverability

Schema + structured pages (AI pulls from structured data).

Knowledge Graph sources → Wikidata, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, GitHub.

Q&A-style content (FAQs, blogs) → easily surfaced in ChatGPT/Perplexity.

8. Should You Build an Admin Dashboard?

✅ If you want control + no external CMS.

✅ If content volume will grow a lot.

❌ If you only post 1 blog/month → a headless CMS is easier.

👉 Recommendation: Start with a Headless CMS (e.g., Sanity or Strapi). Later, if Conbyt grows, you can build your own admin dashboard with custom features.

📌 Updated To-Do (New Additions)

 Decide: Stay in React + prerender OR migrate to Next.js (preferred).

 Restructure site → Homepage + About + Case Studies + Blog + Contact.

 Add headless CMS (Sanity/Strapi) for blogs/case studies.

 Add schema for blogs (Article schema) & case studies.

 Optimize Core Web Vitals (LCP, TBT).

 Write FAQ-rich content to appear in AI/Google snippets.

 List Conbyt in external directories (Crunchbase, Clutch, etc.).

 Long-term: consider admin dashboard if publishing volume increases.

⚡ My advice: Migrate to Next.js, connect a headless CMS, expand to multi-page site, and build content around your services.
This will massively boost your SEO + visibility in AI search.
